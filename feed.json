Mention age when it’s relevant to the content, but avoid it where it’s superfluous.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Yes: Ramesh, who is 85, has lived in the village for 75 years.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\">No: Jane (37) says that she’s very happy to give ActionAid £10 a month.</p>\n<p>Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for novice or beginner. For example, don’t say something is so simple your mother can use it.</p>\n<p>We prefer older person to elderly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r5v5sl2\">Gender and sexuality</h2>\n<p>Make content gender neutral wherever possible, and strive to write in a gender-fair way. If you’re writing about a hypothetical person or if you’re unsure of the person’s pronouns, use they or them instead of he/she.</p>\n<p>Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as irrelevant descriptions of appearance.</p>\n<p>Use descriptors of gender identity or sexual orientation as modifiers, not as nouns (for example, transgender person, or lesbian woman). Avoid guessing sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>We support using they or their as singular pronouns.</p>\n<p>As with all acronyms, avoid using LGBTIQ if possible. If you really need to use an acronym, use this version rather than LGBT, LGBTI or LGBTQ.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r5v5sl3\">Race, ethnicity, and religion</h2>\n<p>Avoid using words, images, or situations that reinforce racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes (even stereotypes that may appear to be positive). Avoid the term non-white, or other terms that treat whiteness as a default.</p>\n<p>Don’t make assumptions: ask how people identify themselves, and be aware of complexities within racial, ethnic, and religious identities. For example, not all Arabs are Muslim, and many nationalities and ethnicities include various religious practices and traditions.</p>\n<p>When referring to a person’s race or ethnicity, use adjectives, not nouns (for example, a Hispanic person, not a Hispanic).</p>\n<p>Talk about indigenous people, but avoid capitalising, which makes this seem like an official label, and emphasises otherness.</p>",

Are you requesting personal, or more general, information? How might this affect people’s frame of mind?</p>\n<p>Consider the purpose and situational context of the form you’re designing, along with the type of information you’re collecting. For example, if you’re preparing a form someone will use to subscribe, you might use a matter-of-fact tone. If you’re designing a form people can use to register for an event, you might use a livelier tone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s13\">Start with easier questions</h3>\n<p>In addition to tone, the sequence of your form’s questions can influence the user experience. Starting with easier questions helps people ease into the experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s14\">Provide enough context</h3>\n<p>Understanding people’s possible attitudes toward the requests you’re making can help you work out where to provide contextual information and how much to provide. You may want to share why you need this information and explain what you’ll be doing to protect it. Providing this context can help users feel more at ease and create a more satisfying interaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s15\">Design with devices in mind</h3>\n<p>We strive to design content that’s equally accessible — and enjoyable — across all devices. That said, keeping users’ device preferences in mind can help us make decisions about form language.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s16\">Keep it concise</h3>\n<p>Brevity is especially important when creating forms. People are completing your form to achieve a certain end; don’t create more work for them by using unwieldy or long-winded descriptions.</p>\n<p>Create labels that are concise and to the point.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s17\">Align field length with response length</h3>\n<p>Fields should be the right size for the information you’re requesting. Fields for capturing a first or a last name or a city of residence can be short; fields meant to capture longer responses – a complaint or request, for instance – should be sized so that people can see what they’re typing before submitting it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s18\">Don’t make optional information required</h3>\n<p>If a piece of information is optional, tell people. Requiring only the information that’s really required will save time.</p>",
