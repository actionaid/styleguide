Are you requesting personal, or more general, information? How might this affect people’s frame of mind?</p>\n<p>Consider the purpose and situational context of the form you’re designing, along with the type of information you’re collecting. For example, if you’re preparing a form someone will use to subscribe, you might use a matter-of-fact tone. If you’re designing a form people can use to register for an event, you might use a livelier tone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s13\">Start with easier questions</h3>\n<p>In addition to tone, the sequence of your form’s questions can influence the user experience. Starting with easier questions helps people ease into the experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s14\">Provide enough context</h3>\n<p>Understanding people’s possible attitudes toward the requests you’re making can help you work out where to provide contextual information and how much to provide. You may want to share why you need this information and explain what you’ll be doing to protect it. Providing this context can help users feel more at ease and create a more satisfying interaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s15\">Design with devices in mind</h3>\n<p>We strive to design content that’s equally accessible — and enjoyable — across all devices. That said, keeping users’ device preferences in mind can help us make decisions about form language.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s16\">Keep it concise</h3>\n<p>Brevity is especially important when creating forms. People are completing your form to achieve a certain end; don’t create more work for them by using unwieldy or long-winded descriptions.</p>\n<p>Create labels that are concise and to the point — “First name” is much easier to comprehend at a glance than “What moniker do you go by?” Short labels are also easier to read on mobile, and potentially save money on translations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s17\">Align field length with response length</h3>\n<p>Fields should be the right size for the information you’re requesting. Fields for capturing a first or a last name or a city of residence can be short; fields meant to capture longer responses – a complaint or request, for instance – should be sized so that people can see what they’re typing before submitting it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1d1r6j8s18\">Don’t make optional information required</h3>\n<p>If a piece of information is optional, tell people. Requiring only the information that’s really required will save time.</p>",
