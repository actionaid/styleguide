                <p>The words we use can make the difference between forging positive connections or creating distance in our personal and professional lives. Particularly in writing, impact is more important than intent.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that our content is accessible and welcoming to everyone who uses it. Inclusive language helps us to be more accurate and build trust with our users.</p>
<p>This guidance is influenced by the <a href="http://consciousstyleguide.com/">Conscious Style Guide</a>, <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.sumofus.org/images/SUMOFUS_PROGRESSIVE-STYLEGUIDE.pdf">A Progressive’s Style Guide</a> and the <a href="https://www.diversitystyleguide.com/">Diversity Style Guide</a>, all of which are good sources of more detail on inclusive language.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r5v5sl0">Ability and disability</h2>
<p>Every person is a whole person — no matter how they interact with the world. Focus on what they need to do and what tools they use, and avoid making assumptions.</p>

<p>Avoid using terms that contribute to stigmas around disability or mental illness: lame, insane, psycho or schizophrenic.</p>
<p>Avoid using terms that contribute to stigmas around sensory disabilities: blind spot or tone deaf.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r5v5sl1">Age</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the exception of providing detail for a case study, a</span>void defining people by their age, just as you would avoid defining people by the colour of their skin or their sexual orientation. Mention age when it’s relevant to the content, but avoid it where it’s superfluous.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Yes: Ramesh, who is 85, has lived in the village for 75 years.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">No: Jane (37) says that she’s very happy to give ActionAid £10 a month.</p>
<p>Don’t use women or older relatives as substitute for novice or beginner. For example, don’t say something is so simple your mother can use it.</p>
<p>We prefer older person to elderly.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r5v5sl2">Gender and sexuality</h2>
<p>Make content gender neutral wherever possible, and strive to write in a gender-fair way. If you’re writing about a hypothetical person or if you’re unsure of the person’s pronouns, use they or them instead of he/she.</p>
<p>Avoid words and phrases that indicate gender bias, such as irrelevant descriptions of appearance.</p>
<p>Use descriptors of gender identity or sexual orientation as modifiers, not as nouns (for example, transgender person, or lesbian woman). Avoid guessing sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>We support using they or their as singular pronouns.</p>
<p>As with all acronyms, avoid using LGBTIQ if possible. If you really need to use an acronym, use this version rather than LGBT, LGBTI or LGBTQ.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r5v5sl3">Race, ethnicity, and religion</h2>
<p>Avoid using words, images, or situations that reinforce racial, ethnic, or religious stereotypes (even stereotypes that may appear to be positive). Avoid the term non-white, or other terms that treat whiteness as a default.</p>
<p>Don’t make assumptions: ask how people identify themselves, and be aware of complexities within racial, ethnic, and religious identities. For example, not all Arabs are Muslim, and many nationalities and ethnicities include various religious practices and traditions.</p>
<p>When referring to a person’s race or ethnicity, use adjectives, not nouns (for example, a Hispanic person, not a Hispanic).</p>
<p>Talk about indigenous people, but avoid capitalising, which makes this seem like an official label, and emphasises otherness.</p>

<p><strong>blog</strong><br>a blog is collection of blog posts; never use blog to mean a single post; as much as possible, use article instead of blog post.</p>
<p><strong>Côte d’Ivoire</strong></p>
<p>not the Ivory Coast</p>

                    <img src="https://styleguide.actionaid.digital/media/posts/9/" alt="" />
                <p>Ideally, short reports and other publications such as briefings should be created digital-first, because digital content is more accessible and more user-friendly than a PDF. This means that instead of producing a PDF, then uploading it to the website for people to download, the publication is created as a web page, or series of webpages, in the first instance.</p>
<p>The new site allows us to create in depth long-form content that loads faster, is mobile-friendly, is more findable by search engines and is updatable.</p>
<p>Most of our existing publications are PDFs. For those we can create engaging landing pages where people can read a summary of the content online, as well as downloading the PDF.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv0">Do this</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv1">Pull out the interesting stuff</h3>
<p>The content on the page should stand as interesting content in its own right. Start with the issue, not with details about the project or the publication. Downloads add a further level of depth for people who want to explore further.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv2">Think about SEO and your users</h3>
<p>Add details about the project where it gives useful, interesting information but don't prioritise this content.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv3">Paddle, swim, dive</h3>
<p>Publications are often the deepest level of content, offering the full version of the thinking and research. If the full report is the dive and the swim is the executive summary, what’s the paddle?</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv4">Manage expectations, entice</h3>
<p>Let people know a little about what they'll get if they download the report. Encourage deeper engagement, but don’t force it.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv5">Give people ways to get involved</h3>
<p>Some people will be happy paddling; give those people ways to engage (by donating, for example, or by campaigning).</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv6">Like this</h2>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://styleguide.actionaid.digital/media/posts/9/Publication.png" alt="" width="766" height="1651"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv7">Titles should explain what the publication is about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv8">Subtitles allow some additional context. A good subtitle pulls readers in to the content, encouraging them to read more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavv9">Use the publication date of the publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavva">Start with the issue, not with details about the project or the publication. The content on the page should stand as interesting content in its own right. Downloads add a further level of depth for people who want to explore further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavvb">Summarise the problem early on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavvc">Add details about the project where it gives useful, interesting information but don't prioritise this content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavvd">Emphasise the community- and people-powered aspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r8oavve">Let people know a little about what they'll get if they download the report.</p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1d">Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1f">Good links tell people where they’re going to end up when they click on them. Avoid using words that wouldn’t make sense without the link. And definitely don’t use “click here” or “read this”. Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1g">Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Yes</strong>: Read the <a href="http://actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/actionaid_annual_report_2017_0.pdf">annual report</a> for more on ActionAid's impact.</p>

<p>If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.</p>
<p>When drawing on other people’s work, or quoting someone, link to the source. If in doubt, be generous with references.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Pope Francis, in a meeting with indigenous leaders in Rome, <a href="https://www.ifad.org/newsroom/press_release/tags/p16/y2017/39967919">highlighted the need</a> to reconcile development with the protection of indigenous peoples and their territories, “especially when planning economic activities that may interfere with their cultures and their ancestral relationship to the earth”. </p>
<p>Publication titles should be links to the online version of the publication if it’s available, or the source if not.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">ActionAid’s new report, <a href="http://www.actionaid.org/publications/short-changed-how-imfs-tax-policies-are-failing-women">Short-changed</a>, looks at how the International Monetary Fund's current tax policy advice is failing women.</p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s19">Typography and hierarchy is important. It’s a vital element of our design. H1 and h2 headings are used by search engines to understand the structure of our content. Using headings also helps make our content readable and accessible by breaking up text and making it easily scannable.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1a">Formatting</h3>
<p>Each page should have only one h1, the page title. The first level of subheadings are h2s. We also sometimes use h3s, though we avoid using too many different levels. We never use bold, italics or underlining to style text as a heading.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1b">Style</h3>
<p>Headings should be in sentence case. This aids readability and fits with our voice.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1c">Substance</h3>
<p>Text in headings should be concise and informative.</p>

                <p>The following list of strategies will help you create forms people will find easy (maybe even enjoyable) to complete.</p>
<p>Understanding how people might be feeling as they encounter a form can help you make more informed decisions about the right tone to use. Are you requesting personal, or more general, information? How might this affect people’s frame of mind?</p>
<p>Consider the purpose and situational context of the form you’re designing, along with the type of information you’re collecting. For example, if you’re preparing a form someone will use to subscribe, you might use a matter-of-fact tone. If you’re designing a form people can use to register for an event, you might use a livelier tone.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s13">Start with easier questions</h3>
<p>In addition to tone, the sequence of your form’s questions can influence the user experience. Starting with easier questions helps people ease into the experience.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s14">Provide enough context</h3>
<p>Understanding people’s possible attitudes toward the requests you’re making can help you work out where to provide contextual information and how much to provide. You may want to share why you need this information and explain what you’ll be doing to protect it. Providing this context can help users feel more at ease and create a more satisfying interaction.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s15">Design with devices in mind</h3>
<p>We strive to design content that’s equally accessible — and enjoyable — across all devices. That said, keeping users’ device preferences in mind can help us make decisions about form language.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s16">Keep it concise</h3>
<p>Brevity is especially important when creating forms. People are completing your form to achieve a certain end; don’t create more work for them by using unwieldy or long-winded descriptions.</p>
<p>Create labels that are concise and to the point — “First name” is much easier to comprehend at a glance than “What moniker do you go by?” Short labels are also easier to read on mobile, and potentially save money on translations.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s17">Align field length with response length</h3>
<p>Fields should be the right size for the information you’re requesting. Fields for capturing a first or a last name or a city of residence can be short; fields meant to capture longer responses – a complaint or request, for instance – should be sized so that people can see what they’re typing before submitting it.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s18">Don’t make optional information required</h3>
<p>If a piece of information is optional, tell people. Requiring only the information that’s really required will save time.</p>
