<p>A block quote is a way of formatting a longer quote within the normal flow of content.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1k">Pull quote</h3>
<p>A pull quote takes a short extract from the content and pulls it out in order to highlight it and break up text. It repeats content from the flow.</p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1d">Provide a link whenever you’re referring to something on an external website. Use links to point users to relevant content and trusted external resources.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1f">Good links tell people where they’re going to end up when they click on them. Avoid using words that wouldn’t make sense without the link. And definitely don’t use “click here” or “read this”. Write the sentence as you normally would, and link relevant keywords.</p>
<p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1g">Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) when you link text. For example:</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Yes</strong>: Read the <a href="http://actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/actionaid_annual_report_2017_0.pdf">annual report</a> for more on ActionAid's impact.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>No</strong>: Read <a href="http://actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/actionaid_annual_report_2017_0.pdf">the annual report</a> for more on ActionAid's impact.</p>
<p>If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark.</p>
<p>When drawing on other people’s work, or quoting someone, link to the source. If in doubt, be generous with references.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Pope Francis, in a meeting with indigenous leaders in Rome, <a href="https://www.ifad.org/newsroom/press_release/tags/p16/y2017/39967919">highlighted the need</a> to reconcile development with the protection of indigenous peoples and their territories, “especially when planning economic activities that may interfere with their cultures and their ancestral relationship to the earth”. </p>
<p>Publication titles should be links to the online version of the publication if it’s available, or the source if not.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success">ActionAid’s new report, <a href="http://www.actionaid.org/publications/short-changed-how-imfs-tax-policies-are-failing-women">Short-changed</a>, looks at how the International Monetary Fund's current tax policy advice is failing women.</p>

                <p id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s19">Typography and hierarchy is important. It’s a vital element of our design. H1 and h2 headings are used by search engines to understand the structure of our content. Using headings also helps make our content readable and accessible by breaking up text and making it easily scannable.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1a">Formatting</h3>
<p>Each page should have only one h1, the page title. The first level of subheadings are h2s. We also sometimes use h3s, though we avoid using too many different levels. We never use bold, italics or underlining to style text as a heading.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1b">Style</h3>
<p>Headings should be in sentence case. This aids readability and fits with our voice.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s1c">Substance</h3>
<p>Text in headings should be concise and informative.</p>

                <p>The following list of strategies will help you create forms people will find easy (maybe even enjoyable) to complete.</p>
<p>Understanding how people might be feeling as they encounter a form can help you make more informed decisions about the right tone to use. Are you requesting personal, or more general, information? How might this affect people’s frame of mind?</p>
<p>Consider the purpose and situational context of the form you’re designing, along with the type of information you’re collecting. For example, if you’re preparing a form someone will use to subscribe, you might use a matter-of-fact tone. If you’re designing a form people can use to register for an event, you might use a livelier tone.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s13">Start with easier questions</h3>
<p>In addition to tone, the sequence of your form’s questions can influence the user experience. Starting with easier questions helps people ease into the experience.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s14">Provide enough context</h3>
<p>Understanding people’s possible attitudes toward the requests you’re making can help you work out where to provide contextual information and how much to provide. You may want to share why you need this information and explain what you’ll be doing to protect it. Providing this context can help users feel more at ease and create a more satisfying interaction.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s15">Design with devices in mind</h3>
<p>We strive to design content that’s equally accessible — and enjoyable — across all devices. That said, keeping users’ device preferences in mind can help us make decisions about form language.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s16">Keep it concise</h3>
<p>Brevity is especially important when creating forms. People are completing your form to achieve a certain end; don’t create more work for them by using unwieldy or long-winded descriptions.</p>
<p>Create labels that are concise and to the point — “First name” is much easier to comprehend at a glance than “What moniker do you go by?” Short labels are also easier to read on mobile, and potentially save money on translations.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s17">Align field length with response length</h3>
<p>Fields should be the right size for the information you’re requesting. Fields for capturing a first or a last name or a city of residence can be short; fields meant to capture longer responses – a complaint or request, for instance – should be sized so that people can see what they’re typing before submitting it.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r6j8s18">Don’t make optional information required</h3>
<p>If a piece of information is optional, tell people. Requiring only the information that’s really required will save time.</p>

                <p><strong>Description</strong>: Information about a job vacancy.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic aims</strong>: Get the best applicants to apply for ActionAid jobs</p>
<p>Digital-first content on the new site means that where possible, content isn’t hidden away in downloadable PDFs. So ideally, all of the information about the job would be written concisely on a single web page, as it makes it less confusing.</p>
<p>But as second preference, the web page is kept fairly short and all the subheadings are filled in with relevant information, including just enough information about the role for the applicant to decide whether they are potentially suitable. Applicants can then download further information as a PDF.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1d1r8jk850">Do this</h2>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8jk851">Be human</h3>
<p>Writing in a warm and friendly way will show people that ActionAid is a great place to work. Use the future tense and the second person to create an instant rapport with them.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8jk852">Be inspiring</h3>
<p>Use language that excites people about the role, the aims of ActionAid and how they will help to change the world in their new job.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8jk853">Get to the point</h3>
<p>The more concise and focused your job advert copy is, the higher quality of applications you will receive.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8jk854">Think about the user experience</h3>
<p>Applying for a new job can be a stressful process, plus it might be the first time a new person has interacted with ActionAid. Give people a good impression of your organisation by being well organised and sensitive. Be clear about what you expect from them from the start of the process to the finish.</p>

                <p>Profiles are short biographies of staff, board members and contributors. They give a human angle to opinions and to the organisation.</p>
<p>Profiles are linked to from opinion pieces and staff pages.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8g1ut0">Be concise</h3>
<p>A hundred words is plenty. People can find out more about them by clicking on social media links.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8g1ut1">Be consistent</h3>
<p>Use the same format for each profile: what the person’s role involves details of previous relevant experience, a little bit about their background when it’s relevant to their current job, and a couple of personal nuggets.</p>
<h3 id="mcetoc_1d1r8g1ut2">Be approachable</h3>
<p>Portraying the person as down-to-earth doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice talking about expertise. Remember to sound human and avoid jargon, self-importance and listing past glories.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://styleguide.actionaid.digital/media/posts/29/Profile.png" alt="" width="777" height="770"></p>
<ol>
<li>Never capitalise job titles.</li>
<li>Use the third person.</li>
<li>Don’t repeat the person’s job title in the body. Instead, explain what the person does – job titles don’t necessarily communicate this.</li>
<li>When talking about lengths of time, use dates as opposed to a number of years, so the information stays true as it ages.</li>
<li>Include a couple of sentences about their background where it is directly relevant to the person’s current role.</li>
<li>Include a personal detail or two to make them seem like a human.</li>
